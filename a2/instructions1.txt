 For each frame input, eth_switch1 needs to do two things. 
 
 First, it needs to potentially update the switch table based on the input port number and the source address of the input frame. 
 
 Second, it needs to forward the frame to the appropriate output port(s).
 
 If the destination has an entry in the switch table, the frame may be forwarded to the outgoing queue of the specific port.
 
 If the destination is not found in the switch table, forward to all of the ports (except the input port).
 
 The forwarding decision is based on the destination address in the input frame and the current state of the switch table.
 
 SLIDES
 
  Note that the expected behaviour of an Ethernet switch that receives a frame
that is to be forwarded to the same port it came from is to not enqueue that
frame into the buffer of the output port. The frame is simply dropped. There are
unicast cases where this applies. And it applies in all broadcast cases (the
frame either has a dest addr of 0xFF...F or the dest addr is not currently in the
switch table). The frame is enqueued into to all the output buffers of ports
except
for the input port
