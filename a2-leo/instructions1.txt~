 For each frame input, eth_switch1 needs to do two things. 
 
 First, it needs to potentially update the switch table based on the input port number and the source address of the input frame. 
 
 Second, it needs to forward the frame to the appropriate output port(s).
 
 If the destination has an entry in the switch table, the frame may be forwarded to the outgoing queue of a specific port.
 
 If the destination is not found in the switch table, forward to all of the ports (except the input port).
 
 The forwarding decision is based on the destination address in the input frame and the current state of the switch table.
